Abstract: A concise summary of techniques for multiple target tracking is provided and their main characterics assessed qualitatively. The techniques have been catergorised into more than **35 different algorithmic types**. A comparison chart is provided that lists each algorithm and categorises the processing scheme, data association mechanism, complexity scaling (with number of targets and with state dimension), overall complexity and a subjective performance figure. Although some recent filtering theory developments have been omitted, the survey should serve to demonstrate the large variety of ‘classical’ estimation theoretic algorithms already available for the design of multiple target tracking systems. A number of areas deserving of further study are identified in the concluding remarks.
